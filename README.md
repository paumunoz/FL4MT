# FL4MT

## About

This repository includes all the source code used to analyze the results for our proposal to enhance the fault
localization in model transformations using Spectrum Based Fault Localization (SBFL). Our proposal uses static
information to break any ties present in the SBFL analysis.

## Repository organization

### src 

This folder includes all the source code for the different analysis presented in our proposal. All the analysis are 
included in the [Main](https://github.com/paumunoz/FL4MT/blob/main/src/Main.java) file in which you can find the detailed description of them. This file runs the analysis and generates the corresponding output files.

### datafiles

It includes the input and output files used during the analysis. This work is primarily based on two previous proposals [1, 2], and some input files were taken from such.
